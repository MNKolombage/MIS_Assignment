The old town of Galle was once used as a trading port for spices and other goods for over 200 years. However, today, the fort has been transformed into a place of history, romance and beauty where travellers are warmly welcomed to dive head first into the exotic stories and be a part of this heritage site.'

Among its more famous residents are the world\'s biggest concentration of leopards, majestic elephants, sloth bears, sambars, jackals, spotted dear, peacocks, and crocodiles.
